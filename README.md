# ðŸ§  Perceptron Implementation from Scratch ðŸ§ 

## Overview
This project showcases a scratch implementation of the Perceptron algorithm to fit a line between two classes of linearly separable points.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Annotate Points
- Run `gui_inputs.py`.
- Annotate points for two linearly separable classes. This will generate a `.csv` file with the annotated points.

### 2. Fit a Line
- Open and run the '.ipynb' file.
- Use the Perceptron algorithm to fit a line between the points from the generated `.csv` file.

## ðŸŽ‰ Results
- The result will be a fitted line that separates the two classes using the Perceptron algorithm.
